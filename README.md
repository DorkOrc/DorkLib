# DorkLib

## Overview
API functions are all functions under the `do` namespace, for example `do:str/join`.

Data I/O functions are handled by writing to `storage do:io input` (and optionally `storage do:io args`) then running the function, then reading from `storage do:io output`. If no `input` is given but there is still some `output` present, that value will be treated as the input, allowing for stringing together multiple functions without having to manually copy the value back to the `input` from the `output`.

Some functions allow for, or require, some additional arguments. These additional arguments can be written to `storage do:io args` before running the function, or they can be inlined by running the function with a `.` postfixed to the function ID and the arguments specified as the `args` variable of a macro function. For example, you could run
```
data modify storage do:io args set value {separator:"_"}
function do:str/split
```
Or you can inline it as
```
function do:str/split. {args:{separator:"_"}}
```

Once a function is ran, the `input` and `args` fields will be deleted, leaving only the `output`.

  <summary><h2>Raycasting Functions (Voxel Traversal)</h2></summary>

  These functions use a voxel traversal algorithm, so they are both very efficient and very precise. The current implementation does not take into account the physical hitboxes of blocks, and ignores entities.

  <details>
  <summary><h3>Raycast to Block - <code>do:raycast/to_block</code></h3></summary>

  Casts a ray in the direction of execution, then runs a function at the centre of the first block it hits. Entities are ignored. If no block is encountered, stops after "max_distance". Current implementation assumes that all block hitboxes are cubes.
  > `(function: str, require_hit: bool = False, max_distance: num = 64) -> None`
  - `storage do:io args.function` is a string containing a function ID.
  - `storage do:io args.require_hit` (*Optional*) is a boolean. If true, the function will only run if the ray hits a block. Defaults to *false*.
  - `storage do:io args.max_distance` (*Optional*) is a positive number. Specifies the maximum distance that the ray can travel before stopping. Defaults to *64*.
  - `storage do:io args.location_condition` (*Optional*) is a predicate ID or inlined predicate. The condition for what blocks/fluids cam be hit. The predicate is ran at the centre of each block that the ray intersects with. Defaults to *any block that is not air, cave_air, or void_air*.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary><h3>Raycast to Inner Block Edge - <code>do:raycast/to_inner_edge</code></h3></summary>

  Casts a ray in the direction of execution, then runs a function at the inner edge of the first block it hits (always inside the block). Entities are ignored. If no block is encountered, stops after "max_distance". Current implementation assumes that all block hitboxes are cubes.
  > `(function: str, require_hit: bool = False, max_distance: num = 64) -> None`
  - `storage do:io args.function` is a string containing a function ID.
  - `storage do:io args.require_hit` (*Optional*) is a boolean. If true, the function will only run if the ray hits a block. Defaults to *false*.
  - `storage do:io args.max_distance` (*Optional*) is a positive number. Specifies the maximum distance that the ray can travel before stopping. Defaults to *64*.
  - `storage do:io args.location_condition` (*Optional*) is a predicate ID or inlined predicate. The condition for what blocks/fluids cam be hit. The predicate is ran at the centre of each block that the ray intersects with. Defaults to *any block that is not air, cave_air, or void_air*.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary><h3>Raycast to Outer Block Edge - <code>do:raycast/to_outer_edge</code></h3></summary>

  Casts a ray in the direction of execution, then runs a function on the outer edge of the first block it hits (never inside the block). Entities are ignored. If no block is encountered, stops after "max_distance". Current implementation assumes that all block hitboxes are cubes.
  > `(function: str, require_hit: bool = False, max_distance: num = 64) -> None`
  - `storage do:io args.function` is a string containing a function ID.
  - `storage do:io args.require_hit` (*Optional*) is a boolean. If true, the function will only run if the ray hits a block. Defaults to *false*.
  - `storage do:io args.max_distance` (*Optional*) is a positive number. Specifies the maximum distance that the ray can travel before stopping. Defaults to *64*.
  - `storage do:io args.location_condition` (*Optional*) is a predicate ID or inlined predicate. The condition for what blocks/fluids cam be hit. The predicate is ran at the centre of each block that the ray intersects with. Defaults to *any block that is not air, cave_air, or void_air*.

  <summary><h2>Entity Functions</h2></summary>

  <details>
  <summary><h3>Remove Entity Discretely - <code>function do:entity/remove</code></h3></summary>

  Kills the entity without any death animation, loot/xp drops, or vibrations occurring. Strictly speaking, it dismounts the entity's passengers, teleports the entity to the lowest y-position directly below them, then kills them. 

  This function is useful for non-mob entities too, such as markers, as using `/kill` would normally create a vibration at the location of the marker entity - [MC-220397](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-220397).

  This may also be chained in `/execute` as `if function do:remove_entity` to kill an entity which was temporarily summoned with the `summon` sub-command. **Note** that you should make sure to position as the entity *before* running this function as the teleport into the void may cause issues. Unfortunately, I can't make the function teleport the entity into the void, then kill it, then teleport it back - [MC-276062](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-276062).

  This is not intended to be ran as a player but, if it is, they will be killed as if `doImmediateRespawn` is true, `keepInventory` is true, and `showDeathMessages` is false, but without actually changing the gamerules. The player will not be teleported into the void, meaning the death will still trigger sculk sensors and a hurt sound will play. However, this means `entity_hurt_player` advancement triggers will run at the correct location and the `LastDeathLocation` will be saved correctly. Any scoreboards tracking the `custom:deaths` or `deathCount` stats will still increase.

  <summary><h3>Summon Passenger - <code>function do:summon/passenger {id, nbt, function}</code></h3></summary>

  Summons an entity which immediately mounts the executing entity, and then optionally runs a function.
  > `(input: str|None, id: str|None = None, nbt: compound|None = None, function: str|None = None) -> str`
  - `id` (*Required when Inlined*) is an entity type ID. Overrides the `input`.
  - `nbt` (*Optional*) is an NBT compound of tags to summon the entity with. If specified, the entity is summoned with that data directly. If omitted, the entity is summoned with default randomness. `UUID` and `Pos` tags are ignored.
  - `function` (*Optional*) is a function ID (without macro arguments) to run as the entity immediately after it mounts its vehicle. If omitted, no function is ran.

  e.g.
  ```
  execute as @n[type=chicken] run function do:summon/passenger {args:{id:"minecraft:zombie",nbt:{IsBaby:1b},function:"namespace:test"}}
  ```
